# terraform-AWS-static-web

[Terraform](https://terraform.io) configurations for building infrastructure for a [hugo static web](https://gohugo.io) in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

## How to use it

It is supposed you have a user with the appropiate profile in order to make changes in S3, ACM, Route 53, CloudFront. Also a zone for the domain must exists in Route 53.

Customization is made with variables definition that are declared at variables.tf file.

Once you have a provisioned infrastructure, you can [deploy your static web generated by Hugo](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hugo-deploy/).

## Context of this work

This configurations are customizations, updates and improvements on [this shared gist](https://gist.github.com/nagelflorian/67060ffaf0e8c6016fa1050b6a4e767a) by @nagelflorian.

Also there is a very interesting post about this matter:

It has been to me a proof-of-concept for learning Terraform, feel free forking and making improvements on it.
